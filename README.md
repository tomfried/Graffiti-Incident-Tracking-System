# Project Summary
Graffiti Incident Tracking System and Internet Software

## Purpose
To create a website database that might resemble old government looking forms and design it to fit a very modern need (fast-paced, interactive-design, paperless systems).

## How to See
A live version of this code in action can be found at: 

http://teamutah.byethost10.com/ 

**NOTE** - I don't know if this website hosting service is safe or whatever else, so proceed at your own caution, but anyway I originally put the code on there at that address and was confirme to still be working on ~August 1, 2020.

## Known Issues:
- Website is not responsive (no mobile or smaller screen-size support) as it is just a mockup. It is best utilizated on a (1280 x 800) PC or MAC on modern browsers (Google Chrome, Edge, Firefox, etc).
- SQL backend not 100% setup
  - forms do not actually submit, erase or get stored
- Scripting for page security is not really set up, so if the above login credentials do not work, just go to http://teamutah.byethost10.com/home.php

## Name Disclaimer
- I do not own "Team Utah" and "Utah Technologies" is just a psuedo-company name; just ignore it.
