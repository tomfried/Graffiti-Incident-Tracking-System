# Project Summary
Graffiti Incident Tracking System and Internet Software (current)

**Purpose:**
To create a website database that might resemble old government looking forms and design it to fit a very modern need (fast-paced, interactive-design, paperless systems).

A live version of this code in action can be found at:

**NOTE** - I am not familiar yet with scripting nor is the SQL backend 100% setup, so forms do not actually submit, erase, get stored, or update but the UI and UX is fully up for the most part. In addition, the scripting for page security is not up, so if the above login credentials do not work, just go to http://teamutah.byethost10.com/home.php, but I strongly urge you to log in naturally so that some of the hidden elements appear correctly on the page. Also, "Team Utah" and "Utah Technologies" is just a psuedo-company name; just ignore it.

**Additional Note** - Website is not responsive yet (no mobile or smaller screen-size support). I will eventually, but for now, it is best utilizated on a (1280 x 800) PC or MAC on modern browsers (Google Chrome, Edge, Firefox, etc).
